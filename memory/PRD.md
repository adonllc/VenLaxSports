# LeaguePro - Multi-Sport League Platform
## Product Requirements Document

**Last Updated**: Feb 2026
**Version**: 1.1 (Phase 1 — USA: Tennis + Pickleball)

---

## Problem Statement
Build a multi-sport, multi-country league platform (T2Tennis-style) supporting Tennis, Cricket, and Pickleball across USA and India. Players can join leagues, schedule matches, report scores, track standings, and compete across seasons.

**Rollout model (3 phases):**
1. **Phase 1 — USA: Tennis + Pickleball** (ACTIVE) — Stripe, USD
2. **Phase 2 — USA: + Cricket** — Stripe, USD
3. **Phase 3 — India: Cricket focus** — Razorpay, INR

## User Personas
1. **Player (USA)** — Tennis/Pickleball, 18-50, competitive amateur (Phase 1)
2. **Player (India)** — Cricket, corporate, 18-45 (Phase 3)
3. **Admin** — Platform operator managing leagues, payments, analytics
4. **Team Captain (Cricket)** — Registers teams (Phase 2+)

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (Outfit/DM Sans fonts)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) on port 8001
- **Database**: MongoDB (motor async)
- **Auth**: JWT (httpOnly cookies, bcrypt) + Google OAuth (Emergent Auth)
- **Payments**: Stripe (emergentintegrations library) — Razorpay planned for Phase 3

### Phase Gating
- **Single config source**: `frontend/src/config/platformConfig.js` (phase 1/2/3 configs) and `backend/phase_config.py` (mirror)
- Controlled by env vars: `REACT_APP_PHASE` (frontend) and `PHASE` (backend)
- Public API endpoints (`/api/leagues`, `/api/cities`) filter responses by active sports + country
- Admin endpoints remain unfiltered so cross-phase data stays visible to ops
- Frontend UI components (Navbar, Home, Footer, Leagues filter, SportLanding, Auth, AdminDashboard) all read from `activeSports` / `activeCountry`

## What's Been Implemented

### Feb 2026 — Player Search, Ratings, Seasons, Playoffs, Seeds Refactor
- **Seeds refactor** — moved out of `server.py` into `/app/backend/seeds/{admin,cities,leagues,indexes}.py` for scalability
- **Player search** — `GET /api/users/search?q=&league_id=` (2+ char min, optional league scoping, password_hash excluded); `OpponentSearch` typeahead on Player Dashboard match scheduler
- **ELO-style rating updates** — `rating_utils.py` applies small deltas (K=0.05, logistic curve) on every completed tennis/pickleball match; response now includes `rating_change` (winner/loser old/new/delta); cricket untouched (team NRR)
- **Seasons (admin CRUD)** — `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/seasons`, phase-gated to active sports. New Seasons tab on Admin Dashboard.
- **Playoffs bracket generation** — `POST /api/playoffs` + `GET /api/playoffs/:league_id`. Single-elimination seeding (#1 vs #N, #2 vs #N-1, ...) for top 2/4/8/16 players from league standings. New Playoffs tab on Admin Dashboard with bracket preview.
- **Consistent phase gating on league creation** — admin can no longer create cricket/India leagues in Phase 1 (400 error); matches season gating behavior.

### Feb 2026 — Email Notifications (open-source, aiosmtplib)
- New `backend/email_service.py` — MIT-licensed `aiosmtplib`, console fallback when `SMTP_HOST` unset (zero-setup dev)
- Transactional emails on 4 events:
  - `/api/leagues/:id/join` — free-league registration confirmation
  - `/api/payments/status/:session_id` (on paid) — paid registration confirmation
  - `/api/matches` — match scheduled (both players)
  - `/api/matches/:id/score` — match result (both players)
- New `/api/auth/forgot-password` (enumeration-safe) + `/api/auth/reset-password` (JWT token, 30 min expiry)
- New `/api/auth/preferences` PATCH to toggle `email_notifications`
- New frontend: `ResetPassword` page (`/reset-password?token=...`), `ForgotPasswordModal` on Auth page
- New Player Dashboard opt-out toggle (Bell / BellOff pill)
- SMTP env vars (optional): `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_TLS`, `SMTP_SSL`

### Feb 2026 — Phase 1 Enforcement + Google OAuth
- Added `backend/phase_config.py` and env var `PHASE=1`
- `GET /api/leagues` and `GET /api/cities` are phase-filtered; cross-phase queries return `[]`
- New `GET /api/phase` exposes active phase config to the frontend
- Extended `frontend/src/config/platformConfig.js` with `activeSportIds`, `activeSportMap`, `isSportActive`, `activeCountry`
- All frontend sport/country UI reads from the config — Cricket & India are hidden in Phase 1
- **Google OAuth (Emergent Auth)**: `POST /api/auth/google/session` exchanges `session_id` → upserts user → issues existing JWT cookies (no middleware changes)
- `AuthCallback` page handles `#session_id=` fragment before protected routes run
- "Continue with Google" button added to Auth page above the JWT form

### May 2026 — Initial MVP
- Config-driven architecture (`platformConfig.js`, `.env.usa` / `.env.india` templates)
- FastAPI backend: auth, league CRUD, match scheduling, score reporting, standings, Stripe checkout, admin panel
- React frontend: Home, Auth, Leagues list, LeagueDetail, Player/Admin dashboards, SportLanding, ScoreReport, Standings
- 9 seeded sample leagues, 15 seeded cities, admin account, bcrypt password hashing, JWT refresh flow

## Credentials
- Admin (JWT): `admin@leaguepro.com` / `Admin@123`
- Google OAuth: Emergent Auth flow (no app-managed passwords)
- See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`
